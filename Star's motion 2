CONCLUSION:

Using a MATLAB script, we can easily calculate the red shift for any star in the data set. 
We could even perform the same operations for all of the stars in the collected data set.

However, we have found the Hydrogen-alpha wavelength of the star by finding the minimum value of the spectral intensities (s). 
For some stars, the Hydrogen-alpha line occurs at the maximum intensity value, rather than the minimum. 
Therefore, a more robust approach is to find the maximum anomaly (difference from the mean), 
rather than the maximum or minimum spectral value. 
The anomaly is defined as the absolute value of the difference between s and mean(s).
