# Stellar-Motion
In this project, MATLAB is used to find the observed wavelength of the hydrogen alpha line of HD94028 and compare to the known wavelength of the hydrogen absorption to determine how fast is the star moving away from the earth.With precise spectro measurements over time, astronomer use this technique to discover the slight oscillations that deterâ€¦
